# Kensington-Foundation-Discord-Bot-Unofficial-

This is a Kensington Foundation Discord Bot [Unofficial] that I made for the application. Got carried away and made a bot that advises if you have the money or not to make purchase and what you should do.

WARNING!!! 
In order to run this code using your discord bot.
When you open the code in repl.it.
You must go to .env file and change the "None" in DISCORD_BOT_SECRET=None
To the DISCORD TOKEN for your bot. 
You can also change TOKEN = YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN isntead of TOKEN = os.environ.get("DISCORD_BOT_SECRET")
Note that if the Token is like that people can view due to free account on repl.it being public.
That's why I save the token in the .env
Once you do that you should be able to run your bot. 

If you have any questions about the bot and the code. Add me on Discord or Twitter.
